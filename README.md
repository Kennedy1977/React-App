# React-App

This project utilizes esbuild for efficient building and bundling of a modern JavaScript/React application. It offers fast build times and a simplified development experience with support for ES6+ and JSX out of the box.

## Features

- Fast build times with esbuild.
- Hot reloading for development.
- Production-ready builds.
- Babel integration for advanced JavaScript features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended, **v21.7.3** )
- npm (or Yarn)

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

```bash
gh repo clone Kennedy1977/React-App
cd React-App
npm install
```

# Usage

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
Copy code
npm run start
```

This will launch the server with hot reloading at http://localhost:3000.

## Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
Copy code
npm run build
```

This command compiles the application to the dist folder, ready for deployment.
